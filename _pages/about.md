### me

An academic at heart, I'm in my natural element when discussing neat and novel ideas.  The fastest way to catch my interest is [through a book](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82897656-mundy-reimer), so if you have bibliophilic tendencies, I more than welcome hearing about the latest thing you've read!

I particularly enjoy philosophy and science-fiction, but generally my interests can be quite broad.  In fact, if I were to make up a fictional profession / identity that I'd love to have, I would call myself a '[metaphoratician](https://twitter.com/HarmonicesMvndi)' (like a mathematician-linguist-artist hybrid), who will happily steal concepts, metaphors, and jargon from one field and apply them to another in interdisciplinary fashion. Seeing how well metaphors fit, stretch, and break when transferred from one domain to the next is what definitely sparks joy for me ~*

More srsly, I'm a graduate student studying ~~computational clairvoyance~~ [data science + machine learning](https://mundyreimer.github.io/projects) :)  I also have a [former background in neuroscience & cellular biology](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325676679_Computational_Model_of_Induced_Alteration_of_Synaptic_Activity_in_Medial_Pre-Frontal_Cortex_Mechanistic_Implications_for_Schizophrenia_Psychosis), dabbling quite a bit in both computer science and philosophy as well.  

Besides this personal blog of mine, I [write articles on Medium](https://medium.com/@mundyreimer) about various machine learning + bioinformatics topics, in addition to actively [volunteering and coordinating events](https://pybay.com/team/) in the local Bay Area Python Community.
