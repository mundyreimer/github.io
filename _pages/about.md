### interests

Some of the things I enjoy thinking about:

* Theories of Abiogenesis + the Origin(s) of Life
* Self-Organizing Systems + Biological Complexity Theory
* Biological applications of L-Grammars
* Data compression theories of symmetry in biological systems
* Biosemiotic perspectives
* Evolution across multiple spatial/temporal levels
* Learning & inference as higher-ordered homeostatic regulation
* Predictive processing theories of brain function
* Data compression & thermodynamic theories of sleep 
* Formal Theories of Consciousness
* Development of [Good Regulators](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/books/Conant_Ashby.pdf) in systems
* Applying Graph-theoretic ideas to every nail in sight
* The above applies to Information Theory as well ;)
* Non-classical logical systems
* Interpreting logical systems through a geometric lens
* Geometric interpretations of music [1](https://mundyreimer.github.io/project/project2-new)
* [Alternative mathematical & musical notational systems](https://mundyreimer.github.io/blog/representation-notation-thought)
* [The Sapir-Whorfian Hypothesis](https://mundyreimer.github.io/blog/representation-notation-thought)
* [Constructed languages](https://mundyreimer.github.io/blog/representation-notation-thought)
* History of languages & etymologies of words
* History & [Philosophy of Science + Foundations of Math](https://mundyreimer.github.io/blog/hyper-neat-argument)
* World-building alternative ecologies, biologies, & psychologies
* Mining science fiction for technological inspiration, ethical dilemmas, & societal consequences

### me

An academic at heart, I'm in my natural element when discussing neat and novel ideas.  The fastest way to catch my interest is through a book, so if you have bibliophilic tendencies, I more than welcome hearing about the latest thing you've read!

I particularly enjoy philosophy and science-fiction, but generally my interests can be quite broad.  In fact, if I were to make up a fictional profession / identity that I'd love to have, I would call myself a '[metaphoratician](https://twitter.com/MondayRhymer)' (like a mathematician-linguist-physicist-artist hybrid), who will happily steal concepts, metaphors, and jargon from one field and apply them to another in interdisciplinary fashion. Seeing how well metaphors fit, stretch, and break when transferred from one domain to the next is what definitely sparks joy for me ~*

More srsly, I'm currently an MS student studying ~~computational clairvoyance~~ data science & [machine learning](https://mundyreimer.github.io/project/project2-new).  So basically just your friendly k-nearest neighborhood data scientist :)  Oh, and I also have a [former background in neuroscience](https://mundyreimer.github.io/project/project1-old), dabbling quite a bit in both computer science and philosophy as well.  

I'm also active [volunteering and coordinating events](https://pybay.com/team/) in the local SF Python Community, in addition to founding + formerly running the *East Bay [Deep Learning in PyTorch study group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/BayAreaPyTorchers/about/)* as part of the [Facebook & Udacity Scholarship Challenge](https://www.udacity.com/facebook-pytorch-scholarship), so if you're in the area, say *hi* :)
