### me

An academic at heart, I'm in my natural element when discussing neat and novel ideas.  The fastest way to catch my interest is through a book, so if you have bibliophilic tendencies I more than welcome hearing about the latest thing you've read!

I particularly enjoy philosophy and science-fiction, but generally my interests can be quite broad.  In fact, if I were to make up a fictional profession / identity that I'd love to have, I would call myself a 'metaphoratician' (like a mathematician-linguist-physicist-artist hybrid), who will happily steal concepts, metaphors, and jargon from one field and apply them to another in interdiscplinary fashion. Seeing how well metaphors fit, stretch, and break when transferred from one domain to the next is what definitely sparks joy for me ~*

More srsly, I'm currently an MS student studying ~~computational clairvoyance~~ data science & machine learning.  So basically just your friendly k-nearest neighborhood data scientist :)  Oh, and I also have a former background in neuroscience, dabbling quite a bit in both computer science and philosophy as well.
