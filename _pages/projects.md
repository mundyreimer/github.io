## Math Syntax Analysis + Code Generation

[Math2Code](http://math2code.com/): Engineered the core architecture and [led a team of fellow machine learning & data science students](http://math2code.com/about) in designing a web application that takes in a *picture* of a math equation / notation and automatically converts that into its Python/Numpy equivalent of *working code*.  Presented a working version and demo in front of a VC panel along with 5 other finalists and their products from [our masters program](https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/data-science).

Used: OCR, Mathematical Syntax Analysis, Lexical Analysis & Parsing, Code-Generation & Templating, AWS, Flask, Bootstrap, Jinja2, Sphinx, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Google Analytics, Git Continuous Integration

## Oceanography

 [Project Argo](https://github.com/mundyreimer/argo_sensor_clustering):  Built various machine learning models such as spectral clustering, k-means, & gaussian mixture models ran on PySpark's distributed computing framework to cluster temperature profiles of the fleet of [Argo floating buoys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argo_(oceanography)) around the world.  This network of floats monitors temperature, salinity, currents, and bio-optical properties of the world's oceans, providing sensor measurements for climate and oceanographic research.  [Data set found here](http://www.argo.ucsd.edu/Argo_data_and.html).  Our team's initial project [slide-deck found here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yQh4USQ-taN2zQ36ukN4ExVCNp2EwumFjSiDIEPRv0s/edit?usp=sharing).

## Music & Linguistics

[Experimented with different machine learning classifiers](https://github.com/mundyreimer/iambic_songs) for determining iambic pentameter in song lyrics and sonnets.  Iambic Pentameter is a type of rhythm or meter in which five small groups of syllables called *Iambs* or "feet", which in English are unstressed followed by stressed syllables, are found coupled together.  Poem and sonnet data were obtained and cleaned from a variety of sources like Shakespeare, Keats, Frost, Shelley, and Jackson -scraped texts available on the web, while songs from artists such as Taylor Swift and the Backstreet Boys were obtained from [Data.World](https://data.world/).  

Used:  Text-Parsing, Natural Language Processing, Logistic Regression, Step-Wise Regression, Akaike Information Criteria + Bayesian Information Criteria, Wald Test, Deviance Chi-Squared Test, Cross-Validation, DFFITS, Cook's Distance, Variance Inflation Factor, ROC Curves

## Charity 

[Designed a recommendation system](https://github.com/mundyreimer/school_donations_project) in conjunction with PySpark's Distributed Computing framework that matches classroom charity projects (teachers and their classroom requests) to the most probable donors nationwide.  [DonorChoose.org](https://www.donorschoose.org/about) in partnership with Google helped provide this [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/donorschoose/io) freely available on Kaggle.  Our team's [project slide-deck can be found here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FJU4YzjeObEk91HBzrgQ4pBWyNjErIMun06r4PqKwWI/edit?usp=sharing).

## computational neuroscience

[Built and ran simulations](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325676679_Computational_Model_of_Induced_Alteration_of_Synaptic_Activity_in_Medial_Pre-Frontal_Cortex_Mechanistic_Implications_for_Schizophrenia_Psychosis) of a spiking neural network modeled with endocannabinoid retrograde signaling, GABA-mediated inhibitory, and excitatory Glutamate pathways found in the medial prefrontal cortex of mice.  Attempted to investigate the changes in synaptic activity and firing patterns associated with cannabis use, brain development, and psychosis.  This was done at the Hungarian Academy of Science as part of the Theoretical Neuroscience and Complex Systems group ran by Dr. Péter Érdi and mentored by both Dr. Zoltán Somogyvári and Mihály Bányai.  

I also took part in the separate [BSCS program](http://www.bscs-us.org/) studying neuroscience, cognitive science, and philosophy (as well as the Hungarian language) at Eötvös Loránd University.  This experience allowed me to study, live, and explore Budapest and other European countries ([my old travel blog can be found here](http://baskinginbudapest.blogspot.com/)). 

Used:  MATLAB, Spiking Neural Networks (from scratch)

## electrophysiology 

Researched endocannabinoid signaling mechanisms through recording and analyzing the electrical activity of populations of neurons in the brain slices of mice as part of the Korzus lab under the excellent mentorship of Dr. Jonny Lovelace.  Also wrote a paper and did [my undergraduate honors thesis](https://books.google.com/books/about/Computational_Model_of_Induced_Alteratio.html?id=SjZlswEACAAJ) that is now preserved in the school library's cold dark basement.

Used:  Population-level Electrophysiological Recording, MATLAB, ANOVA, Immunohistochemistry, Neuropharmacology, Behavioral Experiments

## neural networks

Gave talks about the mathematics of neural nets and tapped into the collective hive-mind of people writing proofs.  These [Pacific Summer Unsolved Math Seminars](https://sites.google.com/site/fullertoncollegemathevents/) are ran by [Dr. Dana Clahane](http://staffwww.fullcoll.edu/dclahane/index.html), a kind-hearted and inspiring mathematician who works on cultivating the mathematical curiosity in the surrounding Fullerton, CA community.  He hosts talks given by both students, colleagues, and professional mathematicians.  He also heads the local community college Putnam exam math training on a volunteer basis.

Used:  LaTeX, Mathematical Proofs, Classical Neural Networks

Also [assisted in the research](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3162w51t#page-1) of Dr. Do Hyoung Kim by dissecting fruit fly brains(!) as part of the effort to analyze the peptidergic neural networks underlying ecdysis.  Provided additional help in the milking of neurotoxins produced by the emerald jewel wasp used to make zombie cockroaches ([from which the wasp parasitically reproduces via the cockroaches in the style of the classic Alien movies!](https://youtu.be/qN2XMyxAs5o))
