## tools

[spaced-repetition flashcards](https://www.brainscape.com/profiles/3408543)

Flashcards I made to review various topics using the [spaced-repetition software (SRS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition#Software) called [Brainscape](https://www.brainscape.com/i/212G3).  I try to make it a habit to create new cards whenever studying something new or coming across something interesting I've read online or in a book.  I use 2x daily for 10 minutes each, once after waking up and another right before bed.  Able to be used on phone, tablet, or pc.  Feel free to copy + edit for your own use.  I've used various SRS tools in the past, but Brainscape was one of the few which gave me the personal control of Anki combined with the aesthetic UI of something like Duolingo or Supermemo.  See my post for more on memory hacking.  

(my decks include reviews of beginning & intermediate Python syntax + concepts, Bash/Linux shell commands, Markdown, SQL, basic Machine Learning, basic Deep Learning, Linear Algebra, Statistics, Calculus, and various niche topics I like to study or read about)

## tech

[project jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install)

A scientific-computing environment commonly known as a 'notebook' which features a REPL-like interface to make the combination of programming, experimenting, visualization, and documentation of code very easy in a nice personal lab notebook-like format.  Allows use of programming in a variety of languages (like Python).  I usually recommend downloading and installing everything in one fell swoop using the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) packaging management system and using the newer [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html) instead of the older jupyter notebooks.  Check out the useful widgets and [extensions](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/extensions.html) to make your environment more IDE-like such as adding Git integration, variable-inspecting, etc.  If you need more computational power I recommend the free [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb).  For more advanced IDE needs I currently use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  

**interactive online notebooks**

If you would like to share your notebooks online I recommend a combination of [nbinteract](https://www.nbinteract.com/motivation.html) and [Binder](https://gke.mybinder.org/).  The latter allows you to turn a repository of jupyter notebooks into an executable environment that you can share with others online, while the former does the same thing but turns those notebooks into HTML pages.  Great for creating tutorials or for instructors teaching classes.

## material

[medium articles](https://medium.com/@mundyreimer)

Some articles I've written or read on Medium.

[book reviews](https://www.goodreads.com/mundyreimer)

A list of books + reviews that I've read.  I *love* recommendations (both non-fiction + fiction), so if you think I'd like something definitely hit me up!

**tutorials**

  * How to make your own personal blog / site.  For this site I use a combination of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for working with my HTML + Markdown, and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) for *free* hosting.  Since my daily work has more to do with scientific computing, web-based programming was completely new to me.  I highly recommend first starting with a [free Jekyll template](https://jekyllthemes.io/) and messing around with it from there.  Newbie-friendly + free :)
