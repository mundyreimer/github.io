## tools:

### _~ for studying_

[spaced-repetition flashcards](https://www.brainscape.com/profiles/3408543)

Flashcards I made to review various topics using the [spaced-repetition software (SRS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition#Software) from [Brainscape](https://www.brainscape.com/i/212G3).  I try to make it a habit to create cards whenever studying something new or coming across something interesting I've read online or in a book.  I use 2x daily for 10 minutes each, once after waking up and another right before bed.  Able to be used on phone, tablet, or pc.  Feel free to copy + edit for your own use.  I've used various SRS tools in the past, but Brainscape was one of the few which gave me the personal control of Anki combined with the aesthetic UI of something like Duolingo or Supermemo.  See my post for more on memory hacking.

My decks include:
* [Reinforcement Learning](https://www.brainscape.com/p/212G3-LH-98CG7)
* [Deep Learning](https://www.brainscape.com/p/212G3-LH-7O0LQ)
* [Machine Learning](https://www.brainscape.com/p/212G3-LH-6LO5K)
* [beginning & intermediate Python](https://www.brainscape.com/p/212G3-LH-6LO5O) 
* [Bash/Linux](https://www.brainscape.com/p/212G3-LH-9AYP2) shell commands
* [Markdown](https://www.brainscape.com/p/212G3-LH-9AYP5)
* [SQL](https://www.brainscape.com/p/212G3-LH-9AYOY)
* Linear Algebra
* [Statistics](https://www.brainscape.com/p/212G3-LH-7IOLD)
* [Calculus](https://www.brainscape.com/p/212G3-LH-7VXN7)
* [The Shape of Space: Visualizing Surfaces & Three-Dimensional Manifolds](https://www.brainscape.com/p/212G3-LH-9EJ5Y)
...and various niche topics I like to study or read about :)

*One common misconception is that you can only use flashcards and space-repetition principles for fields like Biology where material often comes in bite-sized facts and being skilled in the art of memorization is important.  I disagree with this and think that you can use flashcards even in computer science and math.  Michael Nielsen talks about this at length and uses spaced repetition to [deepen his understanding of math](http://cognitivemedium.com/srs-mathematics) and [understand academic literature and papers](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html).

### _~ for coding_

[how to make your own personal blog / site](https://medium.com/20percentwork/creating-your-blog-for-free-using-jekyll-github-pages-dba37272730a)

For this site I use a combination of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for working with my HTML + Markdown, and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) for *free* hosting.  Since my daily work has more to do with scientific computing, web-based programming was completely new to me.  I highly recommend first starting with a [free Jekyll template](https://jekyllthemes.io/) and messing around with it from there.  Newbie-friendly + free :)

[scientific computing w/ project jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install)

A scientific-computing environment commonly known as a 'notebook' which features a REPL-like interface to make the combination of programming, experimenting, plotting, visualization, and documentation of code very easy in a nice, personal lab notebook-like format (or you can just use [this online browser-based REPL environment]((https://repl.it/site/features)) if you are new to programming or teaching someone new to programming).  Project Jupyter allows the use of programming in a variety of languages (like Python, R, Julia, Scala, etc).  I usually recommend downloading and installing everything in one fell swoop using the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) package management system and using the newer [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html) instead of the older jupyter notebooks.  Check out the useful widgets and [extensions](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/extensions.html) to make your environment more IDE-like such as adding Git integration, variable-inspecting, etc.  

If you need more computational power I recommend the free [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) or for even more power, learning how to use the cloud computing platform [AWS](https://www.guru99.com/aws-tutorial.html).  

For more advanced IDE needs, I currently use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (there's even a new handy extension that lets you open up a jupyter notebook within VSCode and step through line-by-line ***within an individual notebook cell*** to debug).  Quite useful!  

[interactive online notebooks](https://github.com/SamLau95/nbinteract)

If you would like to share your notebooks online I recommend a combination of [nbinteract](https://www.nbinteract.com/motivation.html) and [Binder](https://gke.mybinder.org/).  The latter allows you to turn a repository of jupyter notebooks into an executable environment that you can share with others online, while the former uses the same concept but turns those notebooks into HTML pages (allowing neat interactive plotting widgets).  Great for creating tutorials or for instructors teaching classes.

### _~ for writing_

[citation manager](https://guides.lib.uchicago.edu/c.php?g=297307&p=1984557) 

See the above link for a side-by-side comparison of the different citation managers available.  I use to just blindly save all the academic papers I read to my Google Drive (albeit in a highly organized topic-based folder system), but when it actually comes to the writing process you'd preferably like something that organizes and automates the citation process of every little tidbit of info that you've ever consumed, which is something that doesn't easily scale when you are just doing things the ol' classical way via saving files in folders.  Plus, some of these citation managers have built-in search in case you want to write about something where you don't remember where you originally read it from (which *will* happen, trust me!)

[pic -> LaTeX converter](https://mathpix.com/)

When I need to write a report or paper using LaTeX to get the correct math symbol type-setting, I often find myself forgetting the proper syntax for how to write certain algebraic manipulations or mathematical symbols.  Instead of always having to look the correct syntax up, I can take a quick screenshot of my digital textbook, wikipedia page, etc, that I'm currently looking at using this handy 'snipping' tool assigned to a hotkey, which then automatically converts the image to the corresponding LaTeX syntax.  Super useful!  

For an online LaTeX editor (browser-based so no messing with downloading+installation of software), I recommend [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/for/authors)!  It has built in templates, allows collaboration, documents history, gives real-time rendering, etc.

### _~ for browsing_

[getting around paywalls](https://unpaywall.org/products/extension)

One of the most handy browser extensions I've used is [Unpaywall](https://unpaywall.org/products/extension).  If you ever come across a paper online that happens to be behind a paywall, this plugin will automatically show a little green tab that pops up showing an open-access version if it is available.

To get around online newspaper / magazine paywalls or monthly free-article limits like those found in the _The Washington Post_, _The New Yorker_, _The Wall Street Journal_, etc, I recommend taking a look at [this list of hacks here](https://medium.com/paywall-hacks/how-to-bypass-virtually-every-news-paywall-705602c4c2ce).  Alternatively, you can use your _Page Inspector_ by right-clicking on a page and then checking the box to disable JavaScript (furthermore, you can find any number of browser extensions that allow you to toggle on+off JS).  

For free versions of textbooks and fiction, you could take a look at [Library Genesis](https://libgen.is/) (If the current link is dead just google it).  There are also other things like *Sci-Hub* (which can also be googled) that some people are against and don't recommend...

[too many tabs?](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/better-onetab/eookhngofldnbnidjlbkeecljkfpmfpg?hl=en)

Like so many others, I am the type of person to constantly open up new tabs in my browser whenever I research a particular subject or just casually browse the web.  To keep your tabs neat and tidy (and help prevent your pc from slowing down due to too many open tabs), this ***better-onetab*** browser extension allows you to temporarily tuck away those tabs into lists with one easy click from which you can restore later.  You can also organize these lists for future reference. 

[navigating your browser w/ vimium](https://vimium.github.io/)

A Google Chrome extension that gives you keyboard shortcuts for navigating your browser, giving you "control in the spirit of the Vim editor".  You can stick to your regular ol' Chrome shortcuts to open+close tabs, go back+forward through a page, etc, but I found the most useful feature of this was the simple pressing down with both my index fingers to automatically assign a 'letter' to each clickable link in the browser window, allowing me to mostly forgo the use of my mouse / trackpad when browsing.  It's customizable too, but just make sure that if you like using shortcuts for your jupyter notebook experience that you also adjust the settings so that these new Vimium shortcuts are site-specific and do not conflict.

### _~ for security + privacy_ 

[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)

As far as I know, the above is the ideal *search engine* with respect to not creating user profiles and putting privacy first.  Think of it like a better version of *Incognito mode* where nothing is saved and it shows all users the same search results.

[Brave](https://brave.com/features/)

I personally use multiple different *web browsers*, but one of my favorites that was recently brought to my attention is *Brave*.  Many neat features are listed in the above link, but the one that stands out is the integrated toggling of [*Tor* mode](https://brave.com/tor-tabs-beta/) for better privacy protection.

[Tails OS](https://tails.boum.org/)

Tails is a version of the Linux operating system that can start on almost any computer from a *USB drive*.  Because it acts as a fresh computer every time you boot it up, it comes with built-in tools like automatically routing internet usage through the Tor network, encrypting your files + emails (*Claws Mail* client), having a built-in chat encryption plugin (*Pidgin*), and most importantly, it "leaves no digital footprint on your machine" by overwriting the system RAM when the OS shuts down, *triggered automatically when the boot medium (USB) is physically removed* ([relying on the Linux kernel's free memory poisoning feature](https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/memory_erasure/)).  [Used by Snowden](https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/29/5664884/this-is-the-most-secure-computer-you-ll-ever-own), the NSA apparently deemed it a major threat to its mission in an [internal presentation in 2014](https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/inside-the-nsa-s-war-on-internet-security-a-1010361.html).

...other low-hanging fruit that might be useful to mention are the use of [password managers](https://www.cnet.com/news/the-best-password-managers-of-2019/) and [VPNs](https://nordvpn.com/).
