### tools

[spaced-repetition flashcards](https://www.brainscape.com/profiles/3408543)

Flashcards I made to review various topics using the [spaced-repetition software (SRS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition#Software) from [Brainscape](https://www.brainscape.com/i/212G3).  I try to make it a habit to create new cards whenever studying something new or coming across something interesting I've read online or in a book.  I use 2x daily for 10 minutes each, once after waking up and another right before bed.  Able to be used on phone, tablet, or pc.  Feel free to copy + edit for your own use.  I've used various SRS tools in the past, but Brainscape was one of the few which gave me the personal control of Anki combined with the aesthetic UI of something like Duolingo or Supermemo.  See my post for more on memory hacking.  

(my decks include reviews of beginning & intermediate Python syntax + concepts, Bash/Linux shell commands, Markdown, SQL, basic Machine Learning, basic Deep Learning, Linear Algebra, Statistics, Calculus, and various niche topics I like to study or read about)

### tech

[project jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install)

A scientific-computing environment commonly known as a 'notebook' which features a REPL-like interface to make the combination of programming, experimenting, plotting, visualization, and documentation of code very easy in a nice personal lab notebook-like format.  Allows use of programming in a variety of languages (like Python).  I usually recommend downloading and installing everything in one fell swoop using the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) packaging management system and using the newer [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html) instead of the older jupyter notebooks.  Check out the useful widgets and [extensions](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/extensions.html) to make your environment more IDE-like such as adding Git integration, variable-inspecting, etc.  If you need more computational power I recommend the free [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb).  For more advanced IDE needs I currently use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (there's even a handy extension that lets you open up a jupyter notebook within VSCode and step through line-by-line **within an individual notebook cell** to debug).  

[interactive online notebooks](https://github.com/SamLau95/nbinteract)

If you would like to share your notebooks online I recommend a combination of [nbinteract](https://www.nbinteract.com/motivation.html) and [Binder](https://gke.mybinder.org/).  The latter allows you to turn a repository of jupyter notebooks into an executable environment that you can share with others online, while the former uses the same concept but turns those notebooks into HTML pages (allowing neat interactive plotting widgets).  Great for creating tutorials or for instructors teaching classes. 

[pic -> LaTeX converter](https://mathpix.com/)

When I need to write a report or paper using LaTeX to get the proper math symbol type-setting, I often find myself forgetting the proper syntax for how to write certain algebraic manipulations or mathematical symbols.  Instead of always having to look the correct syntax up, I can take a quick screenshot of my digital textbook, wikipedia page, etc that I'm currently looking at using this handy 'snipping' tool assigned to a hotkey, which then automatically converts the image to the corresponding LaTeX syntax.  Super useful!

[vimium](https://vimium.github.io/)

A Google Chrome extension that gives you keyboard shortcuts for navigating your browser, giving you "control in the spirit of the Vim editor".  You can stick to your regular ol' Chrome shortcuts to open+close tabs, go back+forward through a page, etc, but I found the most useful feature of this was the simple pressing down with both my index fingers to automatically assign a 'letter' to each clickable link in the browser window, allowing me to mostly forgo the use of my mouse when browsing.  It's customizable too, but just make sure that if you like using shortcuts for your jupyter notebook experience that you also adjust the settings so that these new Vimium shortcuts are site-specific and do not conflict.  

[better-onetab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/better-onetab/eookhngofldnbnidjlbkeecljkfpmfpg?hl=en)

Like many others, I am the type of person to constantly open up new tabs whenever I research a particular subject or just casually browse the web.  To keep your tabs neat and tidy (and help prevent your pc from slowing down due to too many open tabs), this browser extension allows you to temporarily tuck away those tabs into lists with one easy click from which you can restore later.  You can also organize these lists for future reference.

### material

[medium articles](https://medium.com/@mundyreimer)

Some articles I've written or read on Medium.

[book reviews](https://www.goodreads.com/mundyreimer)

A list of books + reviews that I've read.  I *love* recommendations (both non-fiction + fiction), so if you think I'd like something definitely hit me up!

[how to make your own personal blog / site](https://medium.com/20percentwork/creating-your-blog-for-free-using-jekyll-github-pages-dba37272730a)

For this site I use a combination of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for working with my HTML + Markdown, and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) for *free* hosting.  Since my daily work has more to do with scientific computing, web-based programming was completely new to me.  I highly recommend first starting with a [free Jekyll template](https://jekyllthemes.io/) and messing around with it from there.  Newbie-friendly + free :)
