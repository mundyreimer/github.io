A hodge-podge of former work that I've been involved in...
*(I mainly use this to connect all the disparate stuff on the interwebs to one central location)*

## computational neuroscience

[Built and ran simulations](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325676679_Computational_Model_of_Induced_Alteration_of_Synaptic_Activity_in_Medial_Pre-Frontal_Cortex_Mechanistic_Implications_for_Schizophrenia_Psychosis) of a spiking neural network modeled with endocannabinoid retrograde signaling, GABA-mediated inhibitory, and excitatory Glutamate pathways found in the medial pre-frontal cortex of mice.  Attempted to investigate the changes in synaptic activity and firing patterns associated with cannabis use, brain development, and psychosis.  This was done at the Hungarian Academy of Science, while also taking part in the separate [BSCS program](http://www.bscs-us.org/).  This experience allowed me to study, live, and explore Budapest and other European countries ([my old travel blog found here](http://baskinginbudapest.blogspot.com/)).

## neural networks

Gave talks about the mathematics of neural nets and tapped into the collective hive-mind of people writing proofs.  These [Pacific Summer Unsolved Math Seminars](https://sites.google.com/site/fullertoncollegemathevents/) are ran by [Dr. Dana Clahane](http://staffwww.fullcoll.edu/dclahane/index.html), a kind-hearted and inspiring guy who works on cultivating the mathematical curiosity in the surrounding Fullerton, CA community.  He hosts talks given by both students, colleagues, and professional mathematicians.  He also heads the local community college Putnam exam math training on a volunteer basis.
