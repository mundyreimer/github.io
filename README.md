Check out my [blog here](https://mundyreimer.github.io/)!

The topics I write about usually center around biology, cognitive science, physics, mathematics, computer science, and philosophy.  Specifically, I'm interested in questions around what separates Living Systems from non-Living ones, how biological systems self-organize, how do they demarcate self from non-self, and stuff like that.  Basically Abiogenesis, Autopoietics, & Agency are endlessly fascinating to me.  Other random interests include somewhat relevant topics in philosophy, linguistics, logic, notation, and geometry :)
