## Hi there :)

You can check out my [blog here](https://mundyreimer.github.io/)!

You'll probably encounter a hodge-podge of a few disciplines including biology, cognitive science, physics, mathematics, computer science, and philosophy.  

Specifically, I'm interested in questions like these:

* What separates Living Systems from non-Living ones?
* Are there any fundamental patterns or motifs that living systems possess? 
* How do biological systems self-organize? 
* How do systems arrive at a sense of Self?
* How do systems demarcate Self from non-Self?
* How can we best talk about, represent, model, and simulate such systems?

...basically Abiogenesis, Autopoietics, & Agency are endlessly fascinating to me.  

Other random interests include somewhat relevant topics in philosophy, linguistics, logic, notation, and geometry :)
