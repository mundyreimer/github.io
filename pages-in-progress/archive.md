To-Do Notes:

- Create a new version of this file under '_pages' (save this one as a works-in-progress archive)
- Create a tab on the sidebar for this page (and link other social media accounts to here instead of to 'about')
- Link to this page using hashtags on each of the individual article pages' headers.
- Use dusty old library / bookshelf as the featured image

This Archive curates my various articles and projects by topic.  It contains works both finished and in-progress.

Inspired by [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/About) each work is prefaced with my current *Confidence* level in the claims made in the article, or how likely they are to be right, with levels being denoted by terms found in Kesselman's [List of Esimative Words](/docs/kesselman-2008.pdf).  Additionally, since each piece functions more like a set of notes that gets updated over time, there is also a status level that gives when it was last updated.  Finally, each work is also prefaced with the following tags denoting any topics they cover:
## Biology

**Individual Works:**

[Classifying Sepsis Patients with Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/mundyreimer/RL-Sepsis-Prediction)

[Organisms as a specific kind of Information]() 
See many of the papers by Jürgen Jost and this one here as the basis for writing your article: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12064-020-00327-1  Also cite from the following Information Theory book (specifically look at Alex Zahkarvov's review on Goodreads): https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/433443.An_Introduction_to_Information_Theory and show the part where information theory melds with physics to construct a single-molecule variant of Maxwell's Demon and show how this could possibly relate to the laws of thermodynamics.  Also cite the book Life's Rachet and include some concepts from there.
