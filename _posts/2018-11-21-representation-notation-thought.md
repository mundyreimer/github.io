### Resources & Thoughts

Below is a compilation of resources featuring the interplay of mathematics, language, and notation in the spirit of Gottfried Leibniz.  This is a curated collection of other people's work and my thoughts about each regarding how the way we represent concepts and communicate via symbolic notation or graphical means may influence the way we think about these concepts.  This line of thought is commonly called the *Sapir-Whorfian Hypothesis* or *Linguistic Determinism*.

*Note - The curated collection below is a work-in-progress and will be continually updated with new references and thoughts*
