## Resources & Thoughts

Below is a compilation of resources featuring the interplay of mathematics, language, and notation.  In the spirit of Gottfried Leibniz, this is a curated collection of other people's work and my thoughts about each regarding how the way we represent concepts and communicate via symbolic notation or graphical / phonological means may influence the way we think about these concepts.  This line of thought is commonly called the *Sapir-Whorfian Hypothesis* or *Linguistic Determinism*.

*Note - This page is a work-in-progress and will be continually updated with new references and thoughts*
