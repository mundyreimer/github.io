TL;DR - Discussing the potential shape of one's internal information, thoughts, values, rewards, and beliefs inside our Minds, and whether or not we can model these using Hyperbolic Geometry.

Recently I was experimenting with stereographic projection (a point-source of light rather than a parallel-source) of the hyperbolic sphere. Finding a stereographic projection is essentially equivalent to finding a mapping (aka a model) of the hyperbolic sphere to the Euclidean plane, allowing us to view what happens to the Schwarz triangle (2,3,7) tessellation or tiling pattern and how it warps. Notice that in our picture, although sizes and lengths are distorted, angles are the same. This occurs because the lines (called geodesics) that make up the sides of the triangle have to map from originally a circle that goes around a sphere (think similar to Earth's equator) to either a single straight line or the many curved arcs radiating out from the edges of this upper half plane or flat surface (like the bottom of the flat wall behind me). In the upper half plane model (or projection), the geodesics can either form a single straight line going up from the left, or meet once at the boundary (from which it then radiates outward and forms a semi-circle), or meet 0 times.

Why study Hyperbolic geometry? Besides it being beautiful for beauty's sake (see [Escher's art](https://mathstat.slu.edu/escher/index.php/Hyperbolic_Geometry)), it is also a potential candidate for the underlying spatial geometry of our universe. And just like how we can study how energy and matter are shaped or configured in our *external* reality (since this allows us to explain how things like light or heat travels), so too can we study how *internal* information, thoughts, values, rewards, beliefs, and maybe even Self-Awareness itself are shaped inside our Minds.

So what's special about Hyperbolic geometry? Remember how I said that lines begin to radiate outward to form semi-circles in the upper half plane model like my wall in the background? It turns out that in Hyperbolic geometry, as we go outward we have the property that we encounter exponentially more infinite space, making the Hyperbolic plane much much larger than the Euclidean plane, as well as tremendously easy to get lost in (eg - in order to walk from the left of a unit disc to the perimeter, it is an infinite distance away).

Because there are many more degrees of freedom, you allow patterns and structures with incredibly high degrees of branching. In physical models, this would take the form of exponentially more area in the surrounding edges, turning a normally flat disc into one where the edges are highly buckled and "frilly", with lots of saddle points (think like a pringles potato chip or piece of lettuce for each saddle point), basically granting you increasingly more surface area (and evolution knows well the benefits of increasing surface area when it comes to resource exchange, metabolic waste, and heat dissipation).

Could perhaps the physiological increase of surface area from which our cortical homunculus is mapped to, then potentially have downstream effects into one's psychological inner mental space that they navigate through?

And we know from differential geometry that "locally" (or zoomed in) we perceive a hyperbolic surface as Euclidean or flat, but globally it is not (similar to how we locally perceive the earth as flat, when globally it is not). 

Could this be why *we think that we think* in Euclidean terms, due to computational time constraints of perceiving and acting on information *in real life*, whereas perceiving and acting on information *in dream states* are quite different experiences? (or similarly under the influence of certain drugs or neuropsychological conditions like when one experiences [Alice-in-Wonderland Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_in_Wonderland_syndrome))

Could this also be investigated empirically? We can maybe come up with potential perceptual experiments by first coming up with thought experiments of what it would be like from the perspective of an observer living *inside a Poincare disc* (a unit disc composed of a hyperbolic plane), versus the perspective of an observer from an external *outside Euclidean view*.

Because we know that the distances inside the disc appear equal to an outside Euclidean observer whereas within the Hyperbolic plane they get infinitely longer the closer you are to the edge of the disc, then if we were a person living within the hyperbolic plane moving from the left to the perimeter, from the perspective inside the disc we'd be moving at a constant speed and never approach the edge, where from an outside Euclidean observer it would look like we are actually slowing down the more we travel to the edge. From the *outside* we see boundaries and time slowing down, whereas from the *inside* we see infinite space and time staying constant. Perhaps we can design experiments that can differentiate between these perceptual differences in time, speed, and limits?
