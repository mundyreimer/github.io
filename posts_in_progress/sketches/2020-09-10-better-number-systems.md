TL;DR - base 60, base 12, modulus, prime number based systems, geometric systems, maybe even link to a review of the foundations + philosophy of maths series

Potentially segue into the [p-adic number system](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-the-towering-p-adic-numbers-work-20201019/) and potential use-cases (think physical systems that might need fractal-based, recursive, or modular-arithmetic type representations).
